**Sample ASP.NET WebApi - EF code first approch**

Created a database with a foreign key constraint (one to many relationship), using Code First technique in an Entity Framework, seed some sample data and return the data, using the Web API.

Before starting, I assume that you have some knowledge of an Entity Framework code first technique, if not you can learn it here.

**Entity Framework**

Entity Framework is a relational mapper framework. It is an enhancement of ADO.NET, which gives developers an automated mechanism to access and store the data in the database.

**Web API**

ASP.NET Web API is a framework to build HTTP Service, which reaches a broad range of clients including Browsers and mobile devices.

It is an ideal platform to build RESTtful Services.

You can fire normal queries like GET

http://.../api/test
